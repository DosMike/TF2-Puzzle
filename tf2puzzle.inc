/**
 * There are two flags that might not be immediately obvious:
 *  *_ALWAYS_PICK_UP and *_NEVER_PICK_UP
 * I don't know how those exactly influenced behaviour in hl2/hl2dm but i 
 *  decided to use them as follows:
 * - FL_FROZEN entity flag always has priority on MotionDisabled.
 * - if ALWAYS_PICK_UP is set, no further conditions are checked.
 * - then
 *   - if ENABLE_ON_PHYSCANNON is set, ignore the entity movetype and DisableMotion state;
 *     otherwise set MotionDisable if movetype is none or spawned with/something fired DisableMotion
 *   - if NEVER_PICK_UP is set, flag as SpawnFlags
 *   - if mass exceeds the limig (250.0 by default) set TooHeavy flag
 * If of these three flags only TooHeavy remains, it will play a different sound
 *  indicating that the prop is too heavy.

 * - the entity spawned with the DisableMotion flag and physgun pickup won't enable it
